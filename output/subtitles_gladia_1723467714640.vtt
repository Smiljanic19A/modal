WEBVTT

00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:16.067
i mean you talked about georgia how with that in mind how do you use when this is like is it something you will bring up try to use as fuel or just markets

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:26.288
I think it's always important when you come so close to promotion,

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:28.430
I wouldn't speak just about Wembley,

00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:34.955
but also if you are there and finish a championship with 90 points,

00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:37.377
surely you want to be there with automatic promotion.

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:40.279
And each season you are there and it's more like,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.140
yes,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.621
you feel the pain if it's not possible.

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.224
And if you play overall really good playoffs.

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:50.575
We played a fantastic two-legs half-final against Norwich.

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:51.676
Pragmatical,

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:52.817
smart,

00:00:52.877 --> 00:00:53.798
first game away,

00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:54.498
clean sheet,

00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:57.661
and then one of our best performances during the whole season,

00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:58.622
a second leg at home,

00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:01.785
unbelievable atmosphere at Allent Road,

00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:03.706
and even in the final,

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.548
so we won more or less each and every statistic.

00:01:05.568 --> 00:01:06.729
The only statistic that met us,

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:07.009
sadly,

00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:07.830
and we didn't win,

00:01:10.032 --> 00:01:10.753
was the scoreline,

00:01:10.793 --> 00:01:14.136
because I wouldn't say we were the worst side in this final.

00:01:14.912 --> 00:01:15.032
Yes,

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:19.794
because that was definitely more effective and perhaps even a bit more experience in using the chances.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:22.075
If you come so close,

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:23.916
then you want to promote.

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:32.399
And you have to take this also a bit as fuel that the fire is burning and use it as even more motivation to keep going.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.400
And then in the next time of asking,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.522
because it makes no sense right now to dwell on it and to think,

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:37.702
oh,

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:42.824
we were so close and have done so well and would have deserved perhaps also to promote.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:59.967
with all the odds that were in our ways um no it's when when there is a little setback although you perhaps don't deserve it then it's important that you invest even more and work even more consistent and more concentrated on more focus and

00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:12.232
even harder and this is what we're trying to do so obviously the final but but in general the whole season we'll use it in order in order yes to to to to focus our

00:02:12.512 --> 00:02:17.996
everyday work even a bit more and then hopefully also with the outcome that you all wish for.

00:02:18.997 --> 00:02:20.758
And your experience in Germany,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.742
even when you were practicing at the end of the season,

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:27.683
do you feel like you still learn something?

00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:30.885
Yes,

00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:31.966
to be honest,

00:02:32.947 --> 00:02:34.508
if you think you don't have to learn anymore,

00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:38.010
then please retire as a manager because then you're not good enough anymore.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.932
So I'm there each and every day with...

00:02:41.472 --> 00:02:42.833
hundreds of decisions,

00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:45.154
which exercise and training,

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:46.195
which line-up,

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:46.735
what do we do,

00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:49.036
how the next speech,

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:50.477
the next preparation,

00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:50.857
whatever.

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:51.938
And believe me,

00:02:52.938 --> 00:03:03.645
each and every day there was mistakes in my decisions and I always reflect this and try to be better the next day and try to improve and to learn because football is also fluent.

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:09.468
I spoke a lot about you always want to be ahead of the wave and for that you also have to be aware.

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:11.357
What can you do differently?

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.038
How can you surprise the opponent?

00:03:14.078 --> 00:03:16.499
How can you be even better in your positioning?

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.621
My football looks also different to what it was six,

00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:23.001
seven,

00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:23.702
eight years ago.

00:03:23.842 --> 00:03:24.382
So hopefully

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:25.922
I keep improving,

00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:26.703
I keep learning,

00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:28.984
I keep being self-critical,

00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:30.664
and this is more or less my nature.

00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:32.045
Once I got the feeling,

00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:32.805
no,

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:33.185
no,

00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:34.226
I don't do this anymore,

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:36.227
hopefully this is the day when I retire.

00:03:40.348 --> 00:03:48.074
You were saying what kind of feeling there is when you see them going into the campaign.

00:03:48.714 --> 00:03:50.816
After that playoff final defeat,

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:53.097
obviously it's quite a long time going on.

00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:59.582
Did you have to pick the players or find yourself up after such a devastating defeat to go away?

00:04:00.142 --> 00:04:02.584
I just wonder what you did to raise spirits?

00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:22.409
obviously spent some time in the homeland as well over the summer yes first of all i picked myself up because this is also quite important because i need to lead the group it was not possible the first two or three days because the first two or three days um you you have to you have to work you have to function so because if you dwell in the first two or three days it's

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:31.892
important that you are there already with good leadership and give the right messages and even the first days we started then also to to finalize a bit the planning because it wasn't safe when the

00:04:32.712 --> 00:04:38.376
until when the pre-season would start because it's a starting point for the championship campaign.

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:45.781
And also the targets that we had in our head perhaps for potential Premier League return are not realistic anymore.

00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:50.484
So the first week was more or less work,

00:04:50.544 --> 00:04:51.145
I have to say,

00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:55.548
in order to prepare everything for pre-season or at least the first four or five days.

00:04:56.294 --> 00:05:01.979
But then I also needed two weeks without me thinking about football.

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:02.199
Yes,

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:04.662
sometimes a telephone call was even necessary.

00:05:07.204 --> 00:05:07.804
Perhaps,

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:09.286
for example,

00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:11.007
Joe Roden was a topic we wanted to bring in,

00:05:11.007 --> 00:05:14.130
it was clear for us the need to do a few telephone calls.

00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:15.211
But overall,

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.133
I tried to stay a bit away from football,

00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:21.597
didn't watch too much of the tournament in Germany,

00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:22.478
was not tempted to go.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:39.555
to some games because I didn't want to see much of football obviously then yes the bigger games when England played and Germany played of of course but not too many games if I'm really honest yes but then after after two weeks of recharging you

00:05:39.575 --> 00:05:50.658
already feel well football is sometimes heartbreaking but you also miss a little bit and this is more like this feeling increases from day to day and

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.730
If I'm honest,

00:05:51.771 --> 00:05:57.776
after two weeks of relaxing and trying to stay awake and trying to stay away from football,

00:05:58.437 --> 00:06:02.240
we had two more weeks without training.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:17.194
And obviously it was still quite more or less relaxed because I could do the work more or less like the weather was nice in the garden and from the sofa at home it was a lot like player watching on the laptop.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:33.662
telephone calls with our key people with potential new targets preparing also with my coaching stuff already the pre-season finalized the last thing for the training camp so i would say the second part of the summer break was already working but in a quite relaxed mode and then yes first

00:06:33.662 --> 00:06:44.630
day back here it's always the best feeling then to smell the grass again and to feel the grass again and to work with the players on the pitch and believe me once you're then standing there was a new group on the pitch

00:06:45.414 --> 00:06:47.475
you don't feel the heartbreak anymore.

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:48.376
It's more like,

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:48.556
yeah,

00:06:48.656 --> 00:06:49.096
excited,

00:06:49.156 --> 00:06:50.597
everyone is there with a smile on their face,

00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:52.037
wants to play football,

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:52.898
wants to have a ball.

00:06:53.418 --> 00:06:54.038
And right now,

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.859
since this moment,

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:57.620
we're working towards the opening day,

00:06:58.061 --> 00:06:59.401
obviously on Saturday,

00:07:00.102 --> 00:07:06.405
and wanted to make sure that we prepare ourselves in the best possible way to play a successful season.

00:07:07.605 --> 00:07:08.286
You always talk,

00:07:08.306 --> 00:07:08.666
you're awesome.

00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:19.914
Yes,

00:07:19.914 --> 00:07:23.717
it's a great league.

00:07:23.717 --> 00:07:25.018
Are you happy with that target?

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:29.001
Are you happy to be past this point?

00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:31.023
When this club plays in the Championship,

00:07:31.323 --> 00:07:33.525
we could sell all our players.

00:07:33.845 --> 00:07:40.009
We could ask perhaps

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.312
Eddie Gray if he would wear a shirt one more time for the opening day.

00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:44.373
I tell you what,

00:07:44.393 --> 00:07:46.154
the bookies would have always been a favourite.

00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:51.318
This is what we are all about and I don't want to hide behind this factor.

00:07:51.418 --> 00:07:54.441
This club is second to none in its fan base.

00:07:54.481 --> 00:08:00.987
This club is so big and has so much tradition and everyone wants this club to succeed.

00:08:01.027 --> 00:08:03.309
So when you have a look at how many shirts we sell,

00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:07.933
how much excitement we create in the whole country and everywhere,

00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:11.597
it feels like each and every one of our games will be picked again.

00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:16.356
High noon kick-off each and every Saturday in order to be live on telly.

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:18.197
I predicted it will happen,

00:08:18.257 --> 00:08:21.399
so we will have strange kick-off times again during the season.

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:33.685
And I'm struggling to complain because it's just like because this club is so full of excitement and everyone who is connected with this club wants this club to succeed and we will always be the bookies'favourite.

00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:34.226
And for that,

00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:35.146
yes,

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:37.848
I don't want to hide behind the fact,

00:08:37.988 --> 00:08:41.590
but I know that we won't be able to talk as to promotion.

00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:58.138
just by shirt selling will win promotion or whatever for for this club and this group of players it's even more difficult than for any other club for any other group of players to promote because for each and every of our opponents they

00:08:58.158 --> 00:09:09.582
have always the most important game of the season always against us always against it's always the same now when you whatever have a look on on yeah

00:09:11.058 --> 00:09:14.781
The capacity of supporters in the away stadiums,

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.184
when Stoke plays against other teams,

00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:22.266
when Leeds United come in,

00:09:22.246 --> 00:09:22.967
the stadium is full,

00:09:23.087 --> 00:09:23.807
everyone is excited,

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:24.888
they are all on it,

00:09:24.908 --> 00:09:25.969
it's a cup final against them.

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:32.133
You always have to play the most important game for the opponent,

00:09:32.874 --> 00:09:33.575
as Leeds United.

00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:36.236
They leave their hearts out,

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:36.917
they run more,

00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:37.878
they invest more.

00:09:38.714 --> 00:09:46.797
They are there with cards and more like then three days later when they are exhausted they play our opponent from promotion anyhow and they can't run anymore.

00:09:47.357 --> 00:09:48.177
It's an easy win for them.

00:09:48.757 --> 00:09:49.858
But I don't complain about this.

00:09:49.878 --> 00:09:52.278
This is what this club is also all about.

00:09:52.419 --> 00:09:56.880
I want to work for such a such a club and it's great and for that yeah we have to deal with it.

00:09:59.568 --> 00:10:04.555
good thank you thank you very much
