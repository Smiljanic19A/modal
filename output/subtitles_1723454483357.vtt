WEBVTT

00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:05.684
I think it's always important

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:06.784
when you come so close

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:25.954
to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.820
We played a fantastic

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.021
two-legs half-final against Norwich.

00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:53.942
Pragmatical, smart first game, away,

00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:55.943
clean sheet, and then one

00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:57.104
of our best performances during

00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:58.604
the whole season, the second leg at home.

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:01.525
Unbelievable atmosphere at Elland

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:03.766
Road and even in the final.

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.746
So we won more or less

00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:05.607
each and every statistic.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:06.747
The only statistic that mattered

00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:10.829
sadly, and we didn't win, was the scoreline.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.549
I wouldn't say we were the

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.090
worst side in this final,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.291
Yes, Hossam was definitely

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:17.553
more effective and perhaps even

00:01:17.553 --> 00:01:19.774
a bit more experienced in using the chances.

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:23.097
If you come so close, then

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:24.419
you want to promote and you

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:27.441
have to take this also a bit as fuel

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.083
that the fire is burning and

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:30.784
use this as even more motivation

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:34.667
to keep going then in the next time of asking.

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:36.109
Because it makes no sense

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.270
right now to dwell on it and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.611
to think, oh, we were so close

00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:39.412
and have done so well.

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:40.646
would have

00:01:56.608 --> 00:01:58.509
consistent and more concentrated

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.249
and more focused and even

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.050
harder and this is what we're trying to do.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.170
So obviously the final but

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.791
in general the whole season we'll

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:13.453
use it in order to focus our everyday work

00:02:13.453 --> 00:02:15.393
even a bit more and

00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:16.974
then hopefully also with the

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:17.954
outcome that you all wish for.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.459
And you're so experienced

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.200
in championship terms, obviously,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.960
as a manager, but even so,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.081
when you were reflecting at the

00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:26.181
end of last season, did you

00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:27.281
feel that you still learnt a

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:29.822
lot from the first four months here?

00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:33.223
Yes, to be honest, if you

00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:34.003
think you don't have to

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:35.764
learn anymore, then please retire

00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:36.664
as a manager, because then

00:02:36.664 --> 00:02:38.024
you're not good enough anymore.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.905
So I'm there each and every day with

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:44.648
Hundreds of decisions, which exercise

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:47.490
and training, which line-up, what do we do,

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.712
how the next speech, the

00:02:49.712 --> 00:02:51.474
next preparation, whatever.

00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:53.135
And believe me, each and

00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:55.917
every day there was mistakes in my decisions.

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:58.059
And I always reflect this and

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.100
try to be better the next

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.302
day and try to improve and

00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:03.804
to learn because football is also fluent.

00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:05.245
I spoke a lot about you

00:03:05.245 --> 00:03:07.276
always want to be ahead of the wave.

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:10.158
For that you also have to be aware

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:11.359
what can you do different,

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.061
how can you surprise the opponent,

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:15.282
how can you be even better

00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:17.563
in your positioning, whatever.

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.445
So my football looks also

00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:20.966
right now different to my

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:23.127
football was perhaps six, seven,

00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:23.908
eight years ago.

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:25.990
So hopefully I keep improving,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.931
I keep learning, I keep

00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:29.852
being self-critical and this is

00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:30.733
more or less my nature.

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:32.094
So once I got the feeling,

00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:34.856
so right now, no, no, I don't do this anymore.

00:03:34.856 --> 00:03:36.197
Hopefully this day when I retire.

00:03:38.436 --> 00:03:40.637
Hi Daniel, nice to see you.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.637
You were saying after what

00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:44.718
good feeling there is amongst

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:46.459
the squad in pre-season, you

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.939
know, going into the new campaign,

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.900
but after that player

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.161
final defeat, obviously it's quite

00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:53.481
a long time ago now, did you

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:55.302
have to sort of pick the

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.382
players up and indeed yourself up

00:03:57.382 --> 00:03:59.643
after such a devastating defeat to go away?

00:03:59.643 --> 00:04:01.184
I just wonder what you did

00:04:01.184 --> 00:04:02.764
to sort of raise spirits

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.064
and obviously spend some time

00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:06.058
in your homeland as well over the summer.

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:06.779
Yes, first of all I

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.320
picked myself up because this

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.441
is also quite important because I

00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:10.662
need to lead the group.

00:04:10.662 --> 00:04:11.943
It was not possible the first two

00:04:11.943 --> 00:04:13.545
or three days because the

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:16.888
first two or three days you

00:04:16.888 --> 00:04:18.869
have to work, you have to function.

00:04:18.869 --> 00:04:21.011
So because if you dwell in the first two

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.773
or three days it's important

00:04:22.773 --> 00:04:23.914
that you are there already

00:04:23.914 --> 00:04:25.035
with good leadership and give

00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:27.893
the right messages and even the first days

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:30.094
We started to finalise

00:04:30.094 --> 00:04:31.935
the planning, because it was unsafe

00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:34.597
when the pre-season would

00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:37.038
start, because it's a starting

00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:38.939
point for the championship campaign.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.581
The targets we had in our head, perhaps

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:43.762
for a potential Premier League

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:45.783
return, are not realistic anymore.

00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:50.525
So the first week was more or less work,

00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:51.886
I have to say, in

00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:53.247
order to prepare everything for

00:04:53.247 --> 00:04:54.887
pre-season or at least the first

00:04:54.887 --> 00:04:56.309
four or five days.

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.750
But then I also needed two

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.252
weeks without me thinking about football.

00:05:02.252 --> 00:05:03.772
Sometimes a telephone call was

00:05:03.772 --> 00:05:04.733
even there necessary.

00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:10.015
For example, Joe Roden was

00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:11.076
a topic we wanted to bring up

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:12.236
and it was clear for us.

00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:13.737
So I needed to do a few telephone calls.

00:05:14.637 --> 00:05:15.938
But overall I tried to stay

00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:17.138
a bit away from football.

00:05:17.138 --> 00:05:17.958
I didn't watch too much

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:21.640
of the tournament in Germany.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.340
I was not tempted to go

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.721
to some games because I didn't

00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:27.542
want to see much of football obviously then.

00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:28.562
Yes, the bigger games when

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:29.823
England played and Germany played,

00:05:30.983 --> 00:05:32.504
of course, but not too many

00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:33.504
games if I'm really honest.

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:37.486
Yes, but then after two

00:05:37.486 --> 00:05:39.967
weeks of recharging, you already feel

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:44.009
Well football is sometimes

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.490
heartbreaking but you also miss

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.392
a little bit and this is

00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:49.612
more like this feeling increases

00:05:49.612 --> 00:05:51.794
from from day to day and if I'm honest

00:05:51.794 --> 00:05:53.815
after two weeks of relaxing

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:56.217
and trying to stay awake and

00:05:56.217 --> 00:05:57.798
trying to stay away from football

00:05:57.798 --> 00:05:59.319
we had two more

00:06:00.713 --> 00:06:02.656
two more weeks without training

00:06:02.656 --> 00:06:05.479
and obviously it was still quite more

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.381
or less relaxed because I could

00:06:07.381 --> 00:06:08.482
do the work more or less

00:06:08.482 --> 00:06:11.526
like weather was nice in the garden

00:06:11.526 --> 00:06:13.308
and from the sofa at home it

00:06:13.308 --> 00:06:15.831
was a lot like player watching

00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:18.594
on the laptop telephone calls

00:06:18.594 --> 00:06:20.056
with our key people with

00:06:20.056 --> 00:06:21.764
potential new targets and

00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:22.865
preparing also with my

00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:23.946
coaching staff already the

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:26.287
pre-season finalized the last things

00:06:26.287 --> 00:06:27.308
for the training camp so I

00:06:27.308 --> 00:06:28.749
would say the second part of

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:30.791
the summer break was already working

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:32.011
but in a quite relaxed mode

00:06:32.011 --> 00:06:34.073
and then yes first day back

00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:35.654
here it's always the best feeling

00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:37.595
then to smell the grass again

00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:39.157
and to feel the grass again and

00:06:39.157 --> 00:06:40.958
to work with the players on the pitch

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.379
and believe me once you're

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:43.500
then standing there with a new

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.581
group on the pitch you

00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:46.862
don't feel the heartbreak anymore

00:06:46.862 --> 00:06:48.063
so it's more like then it's

00:06:48.063 --> 00:06:49.504
more like yeah excited everyone is

00:06:49.504 --> 00:06:50.905
there with a smile on his face

00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:52.106
He wants to play football, he

00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:54.188
wants to have the ball, and right now,

00:06:54.188 --> 00:06:55.069
since this moment, we're

00:06:55.069 --> 00:07:00.133
working towards the opening day on Saturday,

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:02.476
and we want to make sure

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:04.137
that we prepare ourselves in

00:07:04.137 --> 00:07:05.458
the best possible way to

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:07.600
play a successful season.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.902
You've obviously talked about some

00:07:08.902 --> 00:07:10.503
of the lads who have come

00:07:10.503 --> 00:07:12.004
in, like Rothfeld, Jadon Fogel,

00:07:13.243 --> 00:07:14.324
When this club plays in

00:07:14.324 --> 00:07:15.724
the championship, we could sell

00:07:15.724 --> 00:07:16.705
all our players and yes,

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:40.782
I could ask perhaps if Eddie Gray,

00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:42.623
if he would wear a shirt one more time

00:07:42.623 --> 00:07:43.523
for the opening day and you

00:07:43.523 --> 00:07:44.523
know, I tell you what, the

00:07:44.523 --> 00:07:46.544
bookies would have always as a favorite.

00:07:46.544 --> 00:07:47.864
This is what we are all

00:07:47.864 --> 00:07:51.425
about and I don't want to hide behind this fact.

00:07:51.425 --> 00:07:53.545
This club is second to none

00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:54.505
in its fan base.

00:07:54.505 --> 00:07:56.746
This club is so, so big and with

00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:58.386
so much tradition and everyone

00:07:58.386 --> 00:08:01.047
wants this club also to succeed.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:01.967
So when you have a look

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:03.387
at how many shirts we sell,

00:08:03.387 --> 00:08:05.948
how much excitement we create

00:08:05.948 --> 00:08:08.488
in the whole country and everywhere,

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.509
So it feels like each and

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:11.670
every of our games will be picked again

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.271
so that we always have a

00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:14.631
high noon kick-off each and

00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:17.213
every Saturday in order to be live on telly.

00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:18.473
I predicted it will happen so

00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:19.754
we will have strange kick-off

00:08:19.754 --> 00:08:22.035
times again during the season

00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:23.376
and I'm struggling to complain

00:08:23.376 --> 00:08:24.836
because it's just like because this

00:08:24.836 --> 00:08:26.477
club is so full of full

00:08:26.477 --> 00:08:27.538
of excitement and everyone

00:08:28.378 --> 00:08:29.259
who is connected with this

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.361
club, wants this club to succeed,

00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:33.743
then we will always be the bookies' favorite.

00:08:33.743 --> 00:08:35.504
And for that, yes, I don't

00:08:35.504 --> 00:08:38.746
want to hide behind the fact, but I know

00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:40.548
that we won't be able to

00:08:40.548 --> 00:08:42.249
talk us to promotion or

00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:44.010
just by shirt-selling we'll win

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.652
promotion or whatever.

00:08:45.652 --> 00:08:48.254
For this club and this group of players,

00:08:49.234 --> 00:08:51.396
it's even more difficult than

00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:53.077
for any other club, for any

00:08:53.077 --> 00:08:54.358
other group of players to promote.

00:08:55.692 --> 00:08:56.652
For each and every of

00:08:56.652 --> 00:09:00.434
our opponents, the most important

00:09:00.434 --> 00:09:02.715
game of the season is always against us.

00:09:11.758 --> 00:09:13.798
Capacity of supporters in the

00:09:13.798 --> 00:09:15.659
away stadiums whatever when when

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:17.479
Stoke plays against with all

00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:18.379
respect to Stoke and you

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:19.359
know against other teams they

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.540
are whatever 8,000 yeah when

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.420
Leeds United is coming the

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.200
stadium is full everyone excited

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.081
they are all on it it's

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:26.141
a cup final against them and

00:09:26.141 --> 00:09:27.861
you always have to play it's

00:09:27.861 --> 00:09:31.242
more like the most important

00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:33.202
game for the opponent as Leeds

00:09:33.202 --> 00:09:34.582
United so they are always

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:36.263
always they leave their hearts or

00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:38.723
they run more they invest more they

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:40.044
They are there with cards,

00:09:40.044 --> 00:09:41.505
and more like three days later,

00:09:41.505 --> 00:09:42.466
when they are exhausted, they

00:09:42.466 --> 00:09:45.348
play our opponent from promotion,

00:09:45.348 --> 00:09:47.369
and they can't run anymore.

00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:48.770
It's an easy win for them.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.911
But I don't complain about this.

00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:52.353
This is what this club is all about.

00:09:52.353 --> 00:09:54.674
I want to work for such a club,

00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:55.955
and it's great, and for that,

00:09:55.955 --> 00:09:56.856
yeah, we have to deal with it.

00:09:58.157 --> 00:09:59.578
Thank you very much.

00:09:59.578 --> 00:10:00.458
Good.

00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:00.859
Thank you.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.761
Good luck.

00:10:03.761 --> 00:10:05.062
Thank you very much.

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:05.402
Thank you.
