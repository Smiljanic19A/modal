00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.170
Krastavac Bacan is from

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.612
Plastenik, instead of the market.

00:00:02.612 --> 00:00:03.813
Bacan is made for our buyers.

00:00:03.813 --> 00:00:06.756
There are other vegetables on

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.498
the unseen hills.

00:00:08.498 --> 00:00:10.220
Since I mainly produce paprika,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.241
I mostly sell paprika.

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.502
Manufacturers from the surrounding

00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:13.583
area asked if the vegetables

00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:15.065
were thrown away because of

00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:16.086
the low retail prices.

00:00:20.848 --> 00:00:21.589
The first class costed 80

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:22.471
cents, the second costed 40

00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.013
cents, which would give us a

00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:24.935
quarter of the price.

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:25.556
At that price, it is

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:28.701
literally impossible to produce

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.263
paprika, let alone harvest it.

00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:38.224
We, with 20 or 25 cents,

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:39.644
can't bargain with anyone.

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:42.445
Pick up a ton of cucumbers for 200 euros.

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:43.466
So, where's the water?

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.226
Where's the food?

00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:45.546
Where are the workers?

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:46.207
Where are we?

00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:48.427
The income and expenses explain it all.

00:00:48.427 --> 00:00:51.308
The harvest is almost equal to

00:00:51.308 --> 00:00:52.549
that of an engineer.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.350
The total price does not cover it.

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:04.034
So far, I have thrown 8 to 10 tons.

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:05.714
I felt like I was crying.

00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:06.854
The total prices have now

00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:08.975
grown, so the throwing has stopped.

00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:10.575
But the question is until

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:12.576
when, because the market is not stable.

00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:13.576
We are in front of the

00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:14.836
area where in the spring the

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.697
cabbage grew, which we unfortunately

00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:17.197
had to plow.

00:01:17.197 --> 00:01:18.377
The offered price was 17 cents,

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:18.957
on which we could not

00:01:18.957 --> 00:01:19.817
do our consumption production.

00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:21.458
Desperate farmers are asking

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:22.718
for the protection of the state.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.542
I, as a producer, can't lose half of it,

00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:35.163
and someone else has to get

00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:37.885
rich with my labor and take a euro more.

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:38.765
We don't blame the buyers,

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.946
who offer us very low prices,

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:41.687
because it is clear to us

00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:43.428
that everyone will buy where it is cheaper.

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:44.788
But in order to

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:46.690
protect domestic production, it

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.371
is necessary to introduce, as far

00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:51.552
as I know, from May 1st to October 1st,

00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:52.573
that is, to prohibit

00:01:52.573 --> 00:01:54.574
importation, except for the culture,

00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:56.315
which is insufficient for us.

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.996
The import of food jumped by 11%.

00:01:58.996 --> 00:01:59.756
We pay only 270 million

00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:00.376
euros for vegetables.

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:04.257
Similarly, domestic food is thrown away.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.217
To get to the point where

00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:07.098
that tourist eats our domestic food,

00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:08.138
and not imported from

00:02:08.138 --> 00:02:10.178
Ukraine, Albania, Macedonia and so on.

00:02:10.178 --> 00:02:11.199
Third countries are more

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.319
competitive because they pay

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.719
cheaper labor and do not

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.480
use expensive protective equipment

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.580
that are due to be used

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.800
by the member countries.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.041
And all this food, the

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:22.341
vegetables could not even donate.

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:24.062
They asked, they say, to pay the tax first.
